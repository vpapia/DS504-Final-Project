# DS504 Final Project
This project is an analysis of conjecture Dependencies and Intermediate Proof Step statements from the HOL Light Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP) system. The goals of this project were to group conjectures based on similarities in their Dependencies (foundational axioms) and to build a model that could accurately classify Intermediate Proof Steps based on their usefulness. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques were used to attempt to derive meaningful insights from the data.

All data was downloaded from http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/cek/holstep/.
